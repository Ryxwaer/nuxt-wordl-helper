      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        Wordle is a popular game where you try to guess a secret 5-letter word
        in six tries. After each guess, the game gives you feedback with colors:

      <ul
        class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400"

        <li>
          <span class="font-bold" :style="{ color: 'var(--letter-correct)' }"
            >Green:</span
          >
          The letter is in the word AND in the correct spot.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-bold" :style="{ color: 'var(--letter-include)' }"
            >Yellow:</span
          >
          The letter is in the word BUT in the wrong spot.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-bold" :style="{ color: 'var(--letter-exclude)' }"
            >Grey:</span
          >
          The letter is not in the word at all.

        ðŸ’¡ Using the Helper: Step-by-Step
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        After each guess in Wordle, enter the information you learned into this
        helper:
      </p>
      <ol
        class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400"
      >
        <li>
          <strong
            >Correct Letters (Green
            <span :style="{ color: 'var(--letter-correct)' }">ðŸŸ©</span
            >):</strong
          >
          If you got any green letters, type them into the main 5 input boxes
          exactly where they appear in your Wordle guess. Leave boxes empty if
          the letter isn't green.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Present Letters (Yellow
            <span :style="{ color: 'var(--letter-include)' }">ðŸŸ¨</span
            >):</strong
          >
          If you have yellow letters (they're in the word, just misplaced), type
          them into the box labeled "Present Letters (Yellow)". Don't worry
          about the order.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Absent Letters (Grey
            <span :style="{ color: 'var(--letter-exclude)' }">â¬œ</span
            >):</strong
          >
          For letters that turned grey (not in the word at all), click those
          letters on the interactive keyboard below the input fields. They will
          be marked as excluded.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
        As you add more clues, the list of "Possible Words" below will update
        automatically, showing you only the words that fit all the rules you've
        entered. The list is sorted to suggest words that might help you guess
        the answer faster!
